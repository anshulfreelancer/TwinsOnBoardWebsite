								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was a super tiring day. Mr. Better Half had some deadlines and my help was off early since it was her anniversary today. The girls skipped their afternoon sleep post school and it was a task to handle them. Fortunately, I survived.</p>
<p>By the end of the day with no energy left I was making vain attempts to put them to sleep. The inquisitive heads were active and throwing question-bombs at me. I didn’t even have energy to lose my temper. So I chose to keep mum and not answer. I just sat there with my eyes closed requesting them to sleep every 5 min. Not getting any response to the questions irritated the girls to the core. But relentless they are. They kept probing and then later slept crying. Good or bad, that was the best way I could control myself.</p>
<p><span id="more-719"></span></p>
<p>The last 3 and a half years of parenting have been like a mountain climb. On one hand, life is now much busier than before. But on the other hand, my endurance, efficiency, patience, and stamina have all seen new heights. Or at least I choose to believe so because it keeps me going. I find my mind sending me creative hacks unannounced and my ability to multitask has been like never before.</p>
<p>At times it is tough to believe that how a carefree, chilled out, easily bored, fun freak, and adventurous gal like me has stepped into the shoes of motherhood and managed to survive so far. In other words, it’s like gaining something which I didn’t even know was missing.</p>
<p>Only a mother of twins can tell you how stressful it can be when you have not one but two children kicking off in the middle of the supermarket or crying all night long for no apparent reason ― and you’ve only got one pair of hands to deal with the situation. The daily challenges two babies bring is only part of the story because there is also the guilt that you aren’t able to give your twins the kind of personal care and attention singleton babies get — like cuddling them to sleep or carrying them around all day or simply having one to one time with them. But I am not complaining because no matter how stressful it gets, being a twin mommy is also the most amazing privilege.</p>
<p>The experiences you have in your life changes you as a person. You grow with every single event. Sweet or sour, the memories that you make and the moments that you live impacts you on a personal, mental, and emotional level. From the moment my twins came into my life, we knew that it was our responsibility to teach and guide them, like every parent.</p>
<p>The newly formed little humans have infinite things to explore and learn. In this process, we parents act like a tour guide to them. We teach them about the right and the wrong, we take them to places they have never been, we show them the sights they have never seen. We get engrossed in rearing, educating and helping them to navigate the world. Like little sponges they soak everything. However, in the entire process we don’t realize that it is a two way thing because they are also teaching us some very basic life lessons which form the foundation of a peaceful and happy life.</p>
<p>There are a few life concepts that my girls help me revise every now and then. Some of these ideas I&#8217;ve came across for the first time and there are many which were perhaps already there in my subconscious mind. But now through their innocent acts it’s a part of the my active memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>As a grown up, maybe I keep forgetting that being inquisitive is how we learn. Kids have endless questions to ask. They’re always ready to push any and all the buttons they see. They are teaching us all the time that it is good to be curious.</li>
<li>Kids find their joy in the smallest of the things which we adults don’t do. They continuously remind us to seek the simple pleasures of life.</li>
<li>They never judge. They don’t see colour. They don’t find faults. They don’t notice flaws. The most important life lesson to follow.</li>
<li>My girls scream when they are mad, they squeal when they are happy, and they wail when they are sad. They just let their soul out quietly teaching us to be more expressive with our emotions.</li>
<li>Most of the times, both of them create a mess in the house. The jump, they climb, they tumble, they spill and splash. They are fearless and I have my heart in the mouth all the time. They taste, they try and run headlong into new experiences emphasizing the importance of being bold and daring. That’s how we create memories, isn’t it?</li>
<li>Somehow they have this belief that they can do everything and they can be anything. And we adults let our shortcomings and flaws dictate our dreams and passions. Time to learn and change. What say?</li>
<li>Whenever the girls discover a new activity they embrace it with excitement. The sparkle in their eyes says a lot. Such immense display of pure passion and joy.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the next time you are rushing to finish a chore, or trudging from one stop to another, remember to hold your child longer or skip down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Famous poet William Wordsworth wrote —</p>
<blockquote><p>My heart leaps up when I behold<br />
A rainbow in the sky:<br />
So was it when my life began;<br />
So is it now I am a man;<br />
So be it when I shall grow old,<br />
Or let me die!<br />
<strong>The Child is father of the Man;</strong><br />
And I could wish my days to be<br />
Bound each to each by natural piety.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stealing from Wordsworth, I sometimes mumble, “The child is the mother of the woman.”</p>
<p>I hope you’ll take more pauses to learn the valuable lessons your child has to teach you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The picture is from the prize distribution ceremony last week. It was part of Onam celebrations in our apartment society. Its good to be a part of a community where people from varies cultures celebrate together which gives the kids a way to get a good exposure of various traditions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-714" src="https://twinsonboard.tk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eating-own-cooking-300x195.jpeg" alt="" width="399" height="259" srcset="https://twinsonboard.tk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eating-own-cooking-300x195.jpeg 300w, https://twinsonboard.tk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eating-own-cooking.jpeg 768w, https://twinsonboard.tk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eating-own-cooking-230x149.jpeg 230w, https://twinsonboard.tk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eating-own-cooking-350x227.jpeg 350w, https://twinsonboard.tk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eating-own-cooking-480x311.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>As part of the Onam event, a drawing competition was held for kids belonging to various age groups. I got the girls enrolled for this since they have a keen interest in coloring and drawing. I thought it would be a good experience for them and more than that it will be easy for me to engage them for 2-3 hours on a holiday which is always a herculean task. So I got their bags ready and we arrived at the venue on time. The title for their age group was “My Garden.”</p>
<p><span id="more-713"></span></p>
<p>A 30 minute session of drawing and coloring at home is a part of our daily routine and they had been practicing My Garden for the past 2-3 days. The girls were well versed with all the garden elements. So as soon as the event started they started scribbling on their drawing pad. I don’t need to tell you that it’s unnatural for a 3-4 year child to sit patiently for an hour or more doing one particular thing. Which means to ensure they finish their task during the competition, I had to bribe them in between with chocolates and biscuits. Somehow the girls finished their scribbling and coloring, we packed our bags, I clicked a few pictures and we were back at home. My day so far was as expected and I was successful in my ultimate aim of engaging them for a good time.</p>
<p>Later during the day I got a call from my fellow friend who was also one of the organizers for the event that Avani bagged the first prize in her age group in the drawing competition. We were asked to be present at the venue in the evening for attending the prize distribution ceremony and collect the certificate. My friend also mentioned that the other twin Dhvani’s piece was also good but was finally not selected. I would be lying if I say that I didn’t jump with joy. Although I had enrolled the girls without any such expectation but this piece of news made me super happy. A mother’s joy you know. I called out for my husband in the other room and told him that Avani has stood first. We were all happy and joyous till Dhvani interrupted us.</p>
<p>“Mumma you always say coming 1st or 2nd is not important. To participate is important.” She said this with a grin on her face.</p>
<p>Before I could respond, came the second question from her as she grabbed my hand.</p>
<p>“Then why are you saying that only Betu (this is how she addresses Avani) has stood first? I also participated so I have also come first.”</p>
<p>I held her tight in my arms and said, “Yes. You both did well and you both have come first.”</p>
<p>“Then I will also be receiving a prize on the stage today with Betu?” she asked with a sparkle in her eyes. Yes was the only word I could utter. I looked at Avani from the corner of my eyes who was busy playing with her doll unaffected by the proceedings in the house. She did her job at the competition, got handful of chocolates and was sorted for the day.</p>
<p>Later before the prize ceremony I drove to a nearby store, picked up small gifts for the girls. At the event both the girls climbed up the stage hand in hand. Avani was handed over a gift and a certificate. I quietly requested the chief guest to handover the gift I had got for Dhvani. The lady on the stage was gracious enough to accept my request and understood immediately why I did so.</p>
<p>This experience light up a firework of thoughts in my head. As I continued reflecting on it, two things stood out.</p>
<p>First, whatever you tell your kids gets registered in their subconscious mind. So it becomes important to be aware of what are you telling them. And whatever you teach them or tell them, as parents you need to practice it. As in my case I keep repeating to the girls that “participation is important, coming 1st or 2nd is not.” I say this mostly to avoid the fights between them &amp; also because I don’t want them to become a part of the unnecessary competitive rat race. When the time came, Dhvani applied this teaching practically and reminded me (in her own innocent way) that I need to practice what I preach &amp; I need to eat my own Cooking <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Second, it took my attention towards the conventional grading system we have in our education system. I feel it’s obsolete and it creates a culture of good and bad students. The kids who are motivated by grades complete their assignments with interest and get promoted and those who are not they just leave it midway and are called as low achievers. And that’s the root of academic discrimination. This is harmful for a child and can turn him against learning. So to facilitate real learning it’s important to do it with a backdrop of playful environment. When kids are taught in terms of conversation and narrative feedback, learning becomes an effortless byproduct of the process.</p>
<p>Teaching in itself is a counterproductive activity if the student doesn’t want to be taught. Recently, I was skimming through a book on child psychology called Summerhill and found something interesting —</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether a school has or has not a special method for teaching long division is of no significance, for long division is of no importance except to those who want to learn it. And the child who wants to learn long division will learn it no matter how it is taught.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taking the girls for outdoor play every evening is a routine for me now. And whenever I am out with them, I make it a point to whisper in their ears — “sharing is caring” and “greeting everyone is good” — to ensure that they gel with other kids well and make more friends. This allows other kids also to be a part of their gang of two. Trust me it&#8217;s tough to be a part of the Twin gang.</p>
<p>Recently I&#8217;ve seen them responding and connecting well to everyone. They&#8217;ve started waving to my fellow mom friends and even make friends with the kids a little older than their age group. They&#8217;re usually busy and occupied during this 1 ½ &#8211; 2 hours of outdoor play, affording me some time to finish my pending calls or chit chat with other fellow moms without any <em>Mumma Mumma</em> sounds in between. I just wave at them every 5 mins and throw a flying kiss with a wide smile.</p>
<p>So just when I had started feeling proud of my awesome parenting skills (I don’t wait for others to praise my parenting skills. I do it for myself in my head quite frequently) the shocker came last evening. It all started when I got them ready and we were in the play area sharp at 6pm. They pretended to be all energetic and excited, smiled at everyone and joined their gang for half and hour of uninterrupted cricket.</p>
<p><span id="more-695"></span></p>
<p>Avani spotted a bug and came running to me to report what she had seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mumma! There&#8217;s a small bug and it can fly.&#8221; She hollered.</p>
<p>We all laughed and smiled. Suddenly a fellow mom (who Avani is not very familiar with) said, “Beta, this bug can’t fly. It just crawls.&#8221; That simple comment was enough for Avani to get furious. She started crying at the top of her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mumma this Aunty is not nice. She says the bug can’t fly, but it does fly.&#8221; she mumbled in between her sobs.</p>
<p>I was struggling to pacify her but everything was in vain. By this time, the little commotion had attracted Dhvani&#8217;s attention. She darted across from the other side and came near us.</p>
<p>“Why did you do this to my sister?” she asked angrily from the fellow mom.</p>
<p>“Aww. I didn’t say anything to you beta.” replied the lady softly.</p>
<p>With that Dhvani also burst into tears. Now I had both of them holding me tightly and crying at the top of their voices. To say that I was embarrassed would be an understatement. It&#8217;s hard to explain what my state of mind was at that time.</p>
<p>I somehow managed to carry them back home.</p>
<p>Aggression in kids is very common at this growing age. They use aggression when they figure that it&#8217;s the easiest way to get their point across. They are not able to verbalise their feelings and the anxiety and frustration comes out in the form of aggression. At times it could be for very silly reasons. The outburst can be in any form — screaming, hitting, biting, or kicking. I have witnessed this with my kids and with other kids as well.</p>
<p>So it becomes very important at our end to handle the situation gently especially when the kids are showing a not so gentle behaviour in public. From my self-introspection I concluded that there are a few areas where I need to work on myself to address such situations.</p>
<p>First of all, I need to have a good control on my temper and not feel embarrassed of the kids behaviour when such incidences happen. Although yesterday&#8217;s episode made me furious initially, I was able to control my reflex of shouting back at my kids.</p>
<p>The girls are too young to understand their own emotions. It&#8217;s just a convenient way for them to show their displeasure. Parents need to keep a tab on their own temperament and mood swings while handling kids in such situations.</p>
<p>Secondly it is very important not to judge the kids for their aggressive behaviour. Not every instance of their behaviour needs your approval. I felt I need to admit that this aggression is also a part of them growing up and my responsibility as a parent is to handhold them and guide them peacefully. They&#8217;re just kids and we should let them be. They have the right to behave like kids. Of course they need occasional guidance about the right and the wrong.</p>
<p>Immediate redressal is hardly required. It’s very important to encourage an apology but it Doesn&#8217;t have to be done then and there. I found myself probing Avani to say sorry immediately when she was not even settled and was still in tears. This irritated her even more. Maybe because I was embarrassed of her act. Not maybe, I was and this was wrong on my part. They have to be given time to settle down with their emotions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to give them the understanding of a good and a bad behaviour as they are growing up. Also we need to emphasize on the consequences of both types behaviours. Appreciation on a good behaviour and taking away a privilege in case of a bad one works for me.</p>
<p>Stories is another effective too to give an understanding of a good social behaviour to the kids. Real time narration of an accepted behaviour in form of a story can be a good idea.</p>
<p>The instances like yesterday make me revisit my strategies in the quietness of the night when the girls are asleep. I lie down and do a post mortem of my day. I notice that few ideas work a most backfire. You need to keep rethinking creative ways without any unreasonable expectation that they would work for you each time.</p>
<p>It’s a long way to go. As Sadhguru observed —</p>
<blockquote><p>Parenting is a 20 year project. Once you are into it, you can&#8217;t come out till the project is complete.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of late I&#8217;ve been finding myself engaged in a couple of solo activities. Like walking in the nature, creating art, listening to my favourite music, wandering alone, and watching digital cinema. I felt like connecting with myself through solitude. This took me back to the time when my work commitments made me spend good time in many different metro cities. I was fortunate that my work allowed me to explore new places alongside throwing new challenges for creating a space for myself from scratch every time.</p>
<p>I am a people’s person and I prefer it that way but there were phases when the only company I had was myself and then I gradually started enjoying that. Since then, I&#8217;ve always enjoyed my time with myself. All in all, by far I have mastered the art of keeping myself entertained in solitude. I believe solitude at times is calming and energizing and it helps you to breathe through the experiences.<br />
<span id="more-290"></span></p>
<p>With my life experiences so far I believe that having an emotional connect with yourself sets the foundation of all the healthy relationships in your life. The attributes of self compassion, noticing and naming your feelings, accepting your thoughts and emotions are extremely important.</p>
<p>So the most important relationship is the one you have with yourself.</p>
<p>You aren’t perfect. Nobody is devoid of flaws. And seven billion other humans also fit the same description. So loving yourself with mistakes, regrets, and weaknesses becomes essential. Basically I feel that loving yourself is totally an act of service because it immediately translates into positive energy in the world.</p>
<p>Oh, this won’t make you perfect or flawless, but you will acquire “superpowers” that will make your weaknesses trivial</p>
<p>Recently I stumbled upon an amazing read on the website hackspirit.com where a Psychologist Arthur Aron talks about 36 questions that will help you spark an emotional connection with anyone. I found it enthralling and worth sharing. Having these 36 questions answered for yourself would be quite interesting.</p>
<p>So I would invite the interested lot to play this question answer session with themselves, with their spouse, their BFF’s or anyone else in the closest circle and see if they end up with some interesting findings about themselves.</p>
<p>So here it goes&#8230;</p>
<h3>36 questions that spark a deep emotional connection</h3>
<p>1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?</p>
<p>2. Would you like to be famous? In what way?</p>
<p>3. Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you’re going to say? Why?</p>
<p>4. What would constitute a perfect day for you?</p>
<p>5. When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?</p>
<p>6. If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose?</p>
<p>7. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?</p>
<p>8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.</p>
<p>9. For what in your life do you feel most grateful?</p>
<p>10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?</p>
<p>11. Take four minutes and tell you partner your life story in as much detail as possible.</p>
<p>12. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be?</p>
<p>13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?</p>
<p>14. Is there something that you’ve dreamt of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it?</p>
<p>15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?</p>
<p>16. What do you value most in a friendship?</p>
<p>17. What is your most treasured memory?</p>
<p>18. What is your most terrible memory?</p>
<p>19. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why?</p>
<p>20. What does friendship mean to you?</p>
<p>21. What roles do love and affection play in your life?</p>
<p>22. Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items.</p>
<p>23. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people’s?</p>
<p>24. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?</p>
<p>25. Make three true “we” statements each. For instance, “we are both in this room feeling…”</p>
<p>26. Complete this sentence “I wish I had someone with whom I could share…”</p>
<p>27. If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him or her to know.</p>
<p>28. Tell your partner what you like about them: be honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you’ve just met.</p>
<p>29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life.</p>
<p>30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?</p>
<p>31. Tell your partner something that you like about them already.</p>
<p>32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?</p>
<p>33. If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven’t you told them yet?</p>
<p>34. Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why?</p>
<p>35. Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why?</p>
<p>36. Share a personal problem and ask your partner’s advice on how he or she might handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was lying down on the floor in the living room when Dhvani came running to me. Taking the girls to the beach had been super fun but carrying them in arms once they were exhausted had taken a toll on my neck and the back. Girls are all grown up and it&#8217;s pretty tough now to lift them in arms and walk few yards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mumma! what happened to you?&#8221; Dhvani asked me with a concerned look on her face and a heavy voice.</p>
<p><span id="more-61"></span></p>
<p>The innocence on her face melted my heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a little tired and taking rest some rest,&#8221; I told her.</p>
<p>My answer wasn&#8217;t convincing enough for her so she stood still with the same expressions on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dhvani! Where are you? Come fast! I have made a beautiful castle,&#8221; came Avani&#8217;s voice from the kid&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>Before Dhvani came to me, she was playing kinetic sand with her sister and I was cashing out on that opportunity to lie down in peace.</p>
<p>Failing a quick response from Dhvani, Avani stormed into the living room. To her shock as well, Mumma was lying down which meant something wasn&#8217;t normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mumma, are you okay?&#8221; asked Avani sitting beside me trying to reach out for my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just taking little rest. You both go and play with your kinetic sand,&#8221; I told her. The girls didn&#8217;t move an inch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a pain in your back?&#8221; asked Dhvani again. &#8220;Can I help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even before I could say anything, she started pressing my shoulders with her tiny hands. Avani was quick enough to move her fingers over my forehead and eyes. Those soft little hands all over my face felt surreal.</p>
<p>It took me a while to convince both of them that I was absolutely fine and make them resume their play. Those ten minutes made me witness the most innocent form of love and care. The kind that only a child can offer her parents. Such effortless expression of love.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how important was the expression of love and care to your parents at every age. This summer I was at my brother&#8217;s place with my Mom and Dad. And all I did was just relax, eat, and gain all those pounds back that I had managed to lose in the last two months at the gym. I was living with the agenda of chilling in every way possible. I was relaxed from the kids&#8217; side also since they were in secure hands and all their requirements — feeding, bathing, sleeping, playing — was taken care of by my folks. This golden opportunity comes only once a year.</p>
<p>I decided I would take myself to the old phase when I was single and independent and the only thing I used to do on weekends and after the office was to sleep for countless hours, followed by shopping and eating out.</p>
<p>So there I was. My day would start around 9-10, with no schedule. I was doing things at my own convenience which left my Mom puzzled and irritated.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the way you should behave. You have two kids to look after. You should follow a routine. Act responsibly.&#8221; she would go on. &#8220;You look clumsy, comb your hair, etc. etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re there to take care of the kids, na? So spare me for some time,&#8221; I would tell her with a smile. I knew she was concerned and she too wanted me to relax but in a proper way. But I was giving her the College girl vibe, enjoying all the pampering she was giving me. This is how I am with my Mom. I take her for granted all the time without any guilt. I do it because I know she doesn&#8217;t judge me. She was just concerned.</p>
<p>As my summer vacation ended and while I was leaving back for Bangalore, the feeling was that the time I had spent was too less. The guilt came rushing back that I irritated my Mom a lot and didn&#8217;t express my love and care as much as I should have.</p>
<p>Then another voice in my head consoled me, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Your Mom knows that you do care for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I strongly feel that no matter how grown up you are, expressing love and care for your parents is super important. At every age, the feeling that a parent gets from the love and care received by his/her child is surreal only.</p>
<p>My method of expression of my love and care is different. I am not vocal most of the time. But I realize it&#8217;s important to put it in words. That has another level of healing.</p>
<p>As we grow up, we stop expressing especially to our parents, fearing it would expose the vulnerable side of us. At my place when I show the emotional side of myself to my parents, they feel I am going through some emotional turmoil or issues at some other front of life. It could arouse suspicion in their mind because they know that I usually don&#8217;t tell my problems to them thinking it would worry them.</p>
<p>But like I said, pouring out your feelings to words with your parents, your kids, your spouse, or for that matter, any of your loved ones, will add bliss to their lives. It would give them the taste of innocence of your love.</p>
<p>The way my girls make me feel, my parents deserve the same love from their child.</p>
<p>A child can never grow too old to hug her parents and say, &#8220;I love you, Mom. I love you, Papa.&#8221;</p>
<p>As always, thanks for reading!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am back with another piece from my better half’s treasure box. It’s whimsical.. isn’t it?</p>
<p>Anshul (my husband) sketched this cartoon in the context of the stock market. This could be interpreted as &#8211; in investing, people like buying and selling the stocks but it’s “the holding the stock for a long time” that people don’t like. This is one of the core principles of value investing. It’s an investment tactic that preaches that while investing focus on the company’s long term fundamentals and do not overreact to the short term news that jiggles the stock price. So in the value investing world, it’s important to hold on to the stocks. Investing isn’t my cup of tea so I shall stop talking more about it</p>
<p>Moving on to my zone, if I try to correlate this to our day to day life, I conclude that in life it is important to hold on to a few important things instead of spreading ourselves too thin. What are those things?</p>
<p>This takes me back to my 20’s. Such a carefree time it was. A time when life was rich with possibilities. There was ability, time and agility to live out what I was and what I could be. It was a stage when the personality was evolving. That was also a time for learning a few crucial lessons. A tough but insanely rewarding decade. A time when the mistakes were plenty punctuated by some right choices.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s said that the beginning and the end of every decade of life is marked by significant changes. The transition from the 20s to 30s was gentle as well as turbulent. I would say it was moving from carefree 20s to cautious ’30s.</p>
<p>As I am inching closer to the end of the fourth decade of my life, I have become more thoughtful. The early 30s brought career success, increased self-esteem, and higher tolerance. By the mid 30s realization dawned that how little I know and how much more there is to learn. Although the dust of insecurities settled down, it became clear that the midlife challenges are yet to begin. All in all, 30s feel like a whole new life and I feel like I am standing tall on the maturity meter.</p>
<p>I would be lying if I don’t admit that this life-decade has helped me know myself better. I got the taste of life. I discovered that life, inspite of its complexities, is a continuously evolving flavour. It was a taste of love but also fear, insecurity, loss, change, joy, and gratitude. It both frightened me and exhilarated me. I realized I was someone with spirit. I become excited when I have an idea. I look forward to experiences and anticipate the memorable ones. In the process many a times I come out as a winner. But there are times when I feel let down as well. I get my eager mentality crushed and I feel limited. Life keeps testing me leaving me with the feeler that there are plenty of factors beyond your control.</p>
<p>In such times of disappointments, it becomes important to pull yourself and stand strong. But how do we do that?</p>
<p>My life experiences tell me that I just need to hold on to two things in life — Hope and Faith.</p>
<p>Hold on to hope and faith. Those are the two things that we can’t stand to lose. You can let go of people or hurts but don’t let go of faith. It’s significant, it’s beautiful and it’s what it means to be human. It will help you savour the taste of life and open up limitless possibilities in the times of darkness.</p>
<p>So while you are investing in the valuable stocks of your life, please incorporate hope and faith as your support system. This will help you to hang on to your valuable stocks in the times of crisis and the rewards won’t be anything less than awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

Avani like dressing up in girly attire a lot. Dhavni has started giving me a Tomboyish feel already. So the choice was no brainer about who will be Hanuman and who will be Sita. Getting Dhvani dressed as Hanuman was easy. She already has a toy “Gada” (mace) so I didn’t have to worry about this prop. I wasn’t sure if they would recite the dialogues. Since this was one of their favourite pieces, they were super excited and performed their roles with a lot of enthusiasm. </p><p class="p1">Have a look at all the fun we had.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like most other mornings, today I was struggling hard to make the girls eat their breakfast. I feel like an achiever on the days they eat properly on their own. Sadly these privileged moments are far and few between. In short, how well my girls have performed on the breakfast table drives my mood during the day.</p>
<p>Look, when it comes to feeding my kids, I admit I am a fussy mom. As a result, I sometimes end up messing things. My husband often intervenes and advises me to keep it cool. He tells me to let the kids get away with having had only a small bite. He constantly reminds me that this is small stuff that I shouldn’t sweat over. But it’s not easy to fight the instincts of motherhood.</p>
<p><span id="more-57"></span></p>
<p>Today was no different. We were late for the school and the girls were yet to finish their milk. While Dhvani was relishing her milk, Avani looked uninterested. Feeling hurried I wanted Avani to finish her milk quickly. And then it happened instinctively.</p>
<p>Fabulous! You are gulping your milk so quickly, I told Dhvani, “You are very close to coming first. Well done. Finish it all.”</p>
<p>This caught Avani’s attention. She was clearly irked. Picking up her glass, she said — ”I also want to come first. It’s not Dhvani, it&#8217;s me who will come first.” And with that she emptied her glass little too quickly.</p>
<p>I saw my husband giving me strange looks from the corner of the room. It suddenly dawned on me that he didn’t appreciate my method and I realized my mistake. We had agreed that the last thing we want our girls to do is to turn their lives into a mindless race. Race for grades with peers, race among themselves for seeking their parent’s approval, race for conventional excellence.</p>
<p>We’ve defined our responsibility as parents, i.e., to expose them to a variety of choices and then let them explore the world from thereon.</p>
<p>This incident became our topic of conversation later that day. We spoke about how at a certain stage in our life, we’ve all been exposed to the Rat Race. There are few who totally enjoy it depending upon their individual goals and few who totally shy away from the same. And there are some others who have enjoyed this race initially (when they were much younger) but have toned down at a later stage of their lives. So willingly or unwillingly all of us have been a part of this race during some phases of our lives.</p>
<p>The culture that we are a part of constantly subjects you to a lot of social pressures. While growing up there was the invisible pressure of doing well in competitive exams and striving for bright career.<br />
It was common to get compared with your cousins and friends. Once you are able to choose a career line the next in the row is finding yourself a good job, needless to say slightly better than your fellow friends and classmates. This is followed up by getting married, having kids, owning a home, a car, etc. There is no end to this list.</p>
<p>These social pressures are not always external. Most often they’re a creation of your own mind. The need to maintain a particular lifestyle becomes inevitable and this makes you fall prey to the Rat Race. All of us have faced this at some point and it’s maddeningly hard to resist yourself from getting webbed into this. You’re running on a treadmill — constantly upgrading your lifestyle, your short term and long term goals. All this makes it impossible to break out of this vicious cycle called the Rat Race.</p>
<p>That said, I am not against the idea of competitiveness. I strongly believe that being ambitious and having aspirations in life are very much required to keep oneself going. But you need to keep reminding yourself daily that living like a racing rat is another kettle of fish.</p>
<p>Our tribe is aware of the existence of this rat race. We have been a part of it, we have dealt with it, loved it, hated it experienced it, and I am sure everyone has decided a timeline for themselves to come out of it. In short, we are well aware of the pros and cons of it and we have the capability of handling it. This may not be a serious concern at this hour. What demands attention is refraining kids from being a part of this race at such an early stage.</p>
<p>Once our kids grow up each one of them will have their own individual journeys filled with unique challenges. They will be exposed to this race of excellence on their own timeframe. I feel it would be wrong on our part to handhold them during that phase. They should be left free to take their own calls, live with the consequences of their decisions and learn from them. This is not to say that you don’t want to save them from obvious blunders. But largely your interference should be limited to sharing with them your understanding of right and wrong and your rationale but beyond that, they’re on their own.</p>
<p>We can contribute to the future of our kids by allowing them to build the confidence that they can excel in whatever they choose to do. But we also need to tell them that they don’t have strive for everything that others are doing. Their race should always be with their own self not with someone out there. We need to tell them that Tortoise didn’t win the race because it left the rabbit behind but because it wanted to experiment with its own limitations. Doing at least this bit is in our control, hoping them to be happy in their shoes and space.</p>
<p>Today the world has become more competitive for kids starting at a very early age than it was at our time. There is altogether a different race of excellence being run. The various events and reality shows happening on the Television is a proof that the kids are feeling the pressure to outdo others. On the other hand, it’s heartening to see that new methodologies of teaching is being accepted wherein grades are not given importance, and the methods and practices have changed, norms are being broken. Kids of different, age, likes, and mind are part of a class together.</p>
<p>Coming back to the instance where I was probing Dhvani to compete for the first place, the damage had already been done. The girls picked up a fight later arguing over who would come first. Post that I started reminding them that participation is more important than coming first. Now, whenever the discussion of coming first starts they immediately correct themselves stating that “First and second kuch nahi hota hai, participate karna important hota hai”.</p>
<p>I see a future where the girls will never feel the examination pressure. Rather we plan to give them tiny vacation right before their exams. The only efforts they have to make is to pass the exam.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last summer, the girls and I were in Mumbai for a two month long vacation. Such a relaxed time it was.</p>
<p>The girls were away from their dad for so long for the first time and naturally they were missing him a lot. This was the time when I started telling them about their father’s favourites — his favourite book, favouite movie, food etc. Later I made a video of both of them reciting their dad&#8217;s favourite things. I sent that video to my husband on Father’s day. Needless to say, he adored his 2.5 year old toddlers talking about his favourite stuff.</p>
<p><span id="more-233"></span></p>
<p>Since then their favourite game is playing “What is your favourite?” We play it often. I ask them about their favourite stuff and they tell me one by one. As the girls have grown and become smarter, they now try to give unique answers every time.</p>
<p>“Hey, you can’t have your favourites changing every day” I tell them.</p>
<p>“Who said it has to be the same?” pat comes the reply and leaves me speechless.</p>
<p>Today, they decided to reverse the role in the game. This time I was the one who had to answer their “what’s your favourite” queries. Boy they enjoyed it! And as it happens after most hyperactivity episodes, they dozed off.</p>
<p>When the kids are awake I feel they are not letting finish my other chores. There are always a hundred other things on my mind that need to be finished while kids keep me engaged but the moment they sleep I suddenly feel lost and puzzled that what should I do now. Tonight, after they had slept, I was scanning my phone found myself searching for the video “Ek Chiriya, Anek Chiriya.” It probably came onto my thought screen because earlier in the day I had told Dhvani that it was my favourite song.</p>
<p>The song teleported me back to my childhood. As a kid, “Ek Chiriya” was my absolute favourite. I would jump on my seat every time Doordarshan aired that song. During those days, TV used to be such a wholesome entertainment for kids. Sundays were super special with favourite shows lined up for the whole day. Like all kids, I was glued to the TV watching everything — Chandrakanta, Talespin, Duck Tales, Mahabharat, Ramayana, and many more. The half-hour slots for Chitrahaar on Wednesdays and Fridays were equally exciting. And then how can I forget the most intriguing “whodunnit” drama — Byomkesh Bakshi. Pure nail-biting stuff.</p>
<p>It would be a crime to not mention the Saturday-Sunday evening movie slots on the TV. And as I write this, the old memories are unlocking and reminding me — Alice in Wonderland, Tom and Jerry, Sindbad, and The Jungle Book (Mowgli) were few of my other favourites.</p>
<p>As for outdoor games, I was out in the sun playing games like Hide and Seek, which colour you want, Vish Amrit, Pithoo, Oonch Neech, and Poshampa. The only indoor activity that I enjoyed was the “Gudia ki Shaadi” game. Exploring the world outside the home was a daily part of life then.</p>
<p>Spending time with cousins was the ideal vacation. All of us would gather either at paternal or maternal grandma’s house. That was our definition of having the time of our lives. How I remember sleeping on the mats on the floor in a row under the open sky in the Aangan and playing Antakshari inside the mosquito nets. Throwing stones at the Mango Trees near my grandma’s house and searching for the fallen Ambia every morning — that was my favourite summer pastime. I remember hiding in a corner with my loot of Ambia and relishing it with salt.</p>
<p>When the cousins get together was over, the summer afternoons were spent reading a variety of comics. Chacha Chaudhary, Billoo, Pinki, Nagaraj, Super Commando Dhruv, Baankelal, Hawaldaar Bahadur were some of super favourites. As I grew up, the comics gave way to Nancy Drew, Hardy boys, Sydney Sheldon, and Nicholas Sparks.</p>
<p>Comics was a big part of train journeys. On every station, I would eagerly look for comic vendors. If not a comic, I would pester my Dad to at least get me a Nandan or a Champak. Those were the only books I owned. I remember getting the rest of the comic books on rent during summer holidays. Cheap rents offered by local mom and pop libraries allowed me read a lot of books.</p>
<p>My Milton bottle, the only Yashika camera in the house, the endless collection of cassettes and a Walkman, white pilot pen, the Natraj geometry box, the white Bata Shoe (that almost every friend had) were the most prized possessions.</p>
<p>Playing FLAMES was the criteria to decide whether someone deserved your friendship, love, affection, enmity or sisterhood. After school, nothing was more refreshing than the glass of Roohafza. Birthdays were exciting for two reasons — getting to wear the nicest outfit in the school that day and distributing candies to everyone. Even the power cuts were exciting as we were exempted from the homework and no one objected on our choice to go outside and play in the dark.</p>
<p>Today, as I sit back and let myself dwell in nostalgia, I am glad that my childhood was untouched by technology and the weird trends. It gave me a chance to live and enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Each one of us for sure has had a cherished time.</p>
<p>This walk down the memory lane got me thinking — how important it is to keep the child in you alive and how easily we forget to parent the one within us?</p>
<p>In the hustle bustle of life, trying to strike a perfect balance and playing the roles and responsibilities to the best, we tend to forget the child within us. We start paying too much attention to pieces of advice and etiquettes and we stop taking pleasures in the little things that life has to offer. Being a part of the Rat race we rarely laugh heartily and we start associating life’s pleasures only to the materialistic things. We get so engrossed in conforming to a certain way of living in the society that there’s in no time for feeding our soul.</p>
<p>You don’t stop laughing because you grow old, observed a wiseman, “you grow old because you stop laughing.” So it is never late to remind ourselves that the child within us also needs superb parenting as do our kids. Any child needs love and nurturing to bring peace and joy in his or her life.</p>
<p>But how do you do that?</p>
<p>We just need to liberate ourselves from any form of control, shackles of criticism and opinions. We need to stop worrying about what others will think of us. We need to keep the inner spark alive by doing what we want to, without worrying about what other people would say. As they say, those who matter don’t mind and those who mind don’ t matter.</p>
<p>Let this child break free and indulge in innocent fun. Watch how rejuvenating it feels. You’ll be amazed how quickly the prejudices of the mind start dissolving. It won&#8217;t get you rid of your problems, your hectic schedules, your endless commitments, but it will definitely give you a bigger and a better perspective. You will stop sweating over small stuff.</p>
<p>So let loose, and get yourself engaged in some childlike activity. Allow me to offer few suggestions —</p>
<p>1. How about watching your favourite cartoon from your childhood today?</p>
<p>2. How about getting soaked in colours and playing water balloons this Holi? It&#8217;s just around the corner.</p>
<p>3. How about making paper boats this monsoon and getting wet in the first rain?</p>
<p>Do you see what I am getting at?</p>
<p>How about playing “what’s your favourite” game with the child inside you? The child you have forgotten.</p>
<p>I’ll leave you with this — “In your soul, you are still that small child who did not care about anything else but the beautiful colours of the rainbow.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I got a chance to be at the movies with my husband after a long time. After more than four years. I was elated. Three years of parenting twins and almost a year of high-risk twin pregnancy had deprived me of many such little pleasures.</p>
<p>Motherhood did not come that easy to me. The pregnancy was strewn with scores of 3-hour long scans, multiple tests numerous hospital visits, and medicines. All that sometimes made me feel more like a patient than a pregnant woman.</p>
<p><span id="more-53"></span></p>
<p>The day I got to know I was carrying identical twins (MCDA in medical parlance), I knew the road ahead was not going to be easy, so I decided to take a break from my eight-year-long career. At the same time, the decision to quit the job came easily to me since I was pretty clear of the priorities at that time.</p>
<p>Once the twins came along the challenges mounted. There was barely any time for doing things for self-pleasure. By the time the girls went to bed, I would be dead tired. My days and my nights were devoted entirely to the twins. Another reason for sleepless nights was the guilt that I wasn&#8217;t doing enough for the kids. It was a challenging phase that drained me both emotionally and physically.</p>
<p>It was time when I couldn&#8217;t catch up with friends and other relatives. But it was more out of my self-imposed constraint than any external expectations. I was simply unwilling to relinquish the control over kids&#8217; routine even for a day. This stubbornness on my side left many of my friends and extended family annoyed.</p>
<p>That phase was tough. It was very fulfilling too. Within my constraints I feel I did fairly well. Being homebound I tried my best to cash on every small opportunity to celebrate the time with twins.</p>
<p>These years have been the best years of my life. Touchwood. But I would be lying if I said there were no dull or panic moments. Those difficult moments often left me feeling lonely, disheartened, and sometimes useless. Irritated about the fact that I have not been able to keep pace with others. That I was not able to do things like a normal person, i.e., going out, having fun, and having that ME time. But those sad feelings were short-lived. Most of the times I would dust myself off and be back to my chores.</p>
<p>Finally, last year was a breather. I was able to make some room for myself and get back to what I call the &#8216;normal life.&#8217; A life where you often go out, meet people, do things on your own and be independent. I was now getting time for mundane things such as taking out time for myself, working out a bit, meeting friends and old colleagues, and driving myself around the town. I got back into the professional mode by finding myself a small assignment matching my time and location constraints.</p>
<p>It was exciting to go for a movie after a long gap of four years. But something unexpected happened while I was coming out of the movie hall. A voice in my head asked me, “Is this what you were craving so much since the last four years?”</p>
<p>It was a good movie and I enjoyed it. But it didn’t feel all that different.</p>
<p>“Why the hell was I sad even for a second for missing this?” I told myself.</p>
<p>Similarly when I was able to tick mark the other so-called ”To Do’s,” it all felt normal. No extraordinary feeling of elation.</p>
<p>Maybe I had created a hype in my own mind. There was something else that I was missing. It was the self-confidence that I was missing during the moments of stress and panic. I was missing the independence that was taken away from me by my self-imposed constraints. I allowed those down moments to deprive myself of the self-love. I forgot to tell myself that normal life wasn’t denied to me. It was just delayed by other priorities. Now I understand that although that period of self-doubt was temporary but it were harmful.</p>
<p>So I took away following lessons from my last year’s experience —</p>
<p>1) Be confident about your decisions. Whether you have decided to be a stay at home Mom or you have decided to be a working professional juggling workplace and home, both will have their own challenges. Both will throw moments of guilt and self-doubt. All you have to do is pick yourself up and keep searching for those tiny moments to celebrate life and your kids.</p>
<p>2) ME time and self-love is important. A movie date, coffee date, or a get together are not the only proxies to it. If you can manage it, then it’s like a cherry on the cake but if you are struggling with the household stuff and are stuck, then please don’t make a big fuss about missing those activities. Do whatever is the best within your constraints. Get dressed nicely even if you’re at home. A celebration is a celebration. It doesn’t matter if it’s at home or an outdoor party. Your kids want a happy mother, not necessarily a perfect one.</p>
<p>3) It’s extremely important to make peace with your body and your mind. Never view your postpartum body with dread and resignation. Instead accept it with pride and confidence. Your body has done something miraculous. It has created a new life. Winners, they say, have scars too. The weight gain and the stretch marks aren’t physical flaws. They’re the badge of honour of motherhood. If you aren’t getting time to work on your body, do not let this affect your self-confidence. The day you decide to let go off all the excess weight, you’ll be able to do it or at least try doing it. It’s just a matter of priorities.</p>
<p>4) It is extremely important to focus on physical and mental health. What we women have not been taught is that taking care of oneself is the beginning of taking care of others. Mothering is hard work. It’s constant work. It is so easy to get overwhelmed and stop caring for yourself. But, when you stop caring for yourself, your ability to care for your child is compromised and your ability to enjoy motherhood is impacted.</p>
<p>With my greying hair, the dark circles, the scars and the stretch marks, I walk a little taller because I&#8217;ve discovered a new part of me. Parenthood is the single most important role any human will ever play in the life of another. During my four years of this experience I have definitely missed on many milestones I had set for myself but now I am in no hurry to tick them off my bucket list. Rather I am determined to do it at my choice of place and time along with my girls and also continue setting new milestones for myself to conquer.</p>
<p>So please do not look for excuses to feel pity for yourself, rather embrace your imperfect life and search for your dose of happiness in those imperfections. Be proud of the priorities you have chosen and be headstrong and determined that whatever you seek you&#8217;ll achieve it sooner or later. When you are capable of the miracle of creating a life, you are capable of everything else in the world. There is absolutely no disgrace in greying hair when they have overseen the growing kids.</p>
